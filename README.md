## Known Issues
* Links not compatible/unclickable on the mobile version of Safari
    * Current fix allows users to open external link within same window/tab
* On the mobile version of Chrome, tapping on the hamburger icon could register as two consecutive taps.
* Text will occasionally glitch and partially load. This is a browser issue and will require a browser restart to load correctly.

## Future Features
* Ollie model acts more dynamically based on user interactions
    * Floppy ears
* Text descriptors under icons
* Alternative, non-Three.JS version
